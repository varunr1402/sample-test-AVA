On a rainy day, a little puppy named Coco got lost in the market. He was cold and scared.

Arjun, a kind boy, found Coco hiding near a shop. He fed him biscuits and took him home. Arjun made posters with Coco’s picture and put them up everywhere.

Two days later, Coco’s family saw the poster and came to get him. They thanked Arjun and told him he could visit Coco anytime. Arjun was happy to make a new friend.

Moral: Helping others creates new friendships.
