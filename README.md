Mimi, the white cat, loved to sleep all day. She never helped other cats find food and always waited to be fed.

One day, all the other cats went away for a picnic, and Mimi was left alone. She became hungry but did not know how to find food herself.

Mimi realised that being lazy made life harder. From that day on, she started learning new things and helping others.
