Ravi loved selling mangoes from the tree in his backyard. He set up a small stall every morning and waited for customers with a smile.

One day, a man in a hurry bought some mangoes and accidentally dropped his wallet near the stall. Ravi noticed it after the man had left.

Instead of keeping the wallet, Ravi ran after the man and returned it. The man was so thankful that he came back the next day with his whole family to buy more mangoes.

From then on, Ravi’s honesty became famous in his town, and more people came to buy his fruits.
