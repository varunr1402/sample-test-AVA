Meera loved to paint, but her family could not afford new colours often. One night, she dreamed of a golden paintbrush, and when she woke up, it was real!

Whenever Meera painted with the brush, her pictures came to life. She painted food for the hungry, clothes for the poor, and toys for the children in her village. She never used the magic brush for selfish reasons.

Her kindness made her beloved by all. The more she shared, the brighter her world became.
